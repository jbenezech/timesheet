WIP

Semantic-UI won't install with gulp 4.0 which is installed using aurelia cli.
Need to uninstall gulp, install version 3.x and re-install version 4.0

Also, you'll need to edit the downloaded package, see:
https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4374#issuecomment-236729805

Install in default semantic folder

Then in the installation folder
```gulp build```
